# Senseless Apps: my idea with this is to store (and publicly share in case you're as insane as I am to use these) random, useless apps with the sole purpose of demonstrating different capability from Microsoft cloud technologies.

## Know Your Beer
This App takes photos and identifies beer brands, based on a machine learning model trained using AI Builder capabilities. It's a one page App, simple UI to count beers and their brands.


## NYC 2 ME
Small App to demonstrate mixed reality capabitilies. Canvas App with mixed reality feature and leveraging 3D models hosted online.

## Building Access Request

## Weather App
A very simple app connection to a public connector (MSN weather), and displaying the temperature & feels like based on a location you input.

## CatGPT
App built with Azure OpenAI service. This App sometimes responds as ChatGPT normally would and other times..... just meoows randomly back at you.
